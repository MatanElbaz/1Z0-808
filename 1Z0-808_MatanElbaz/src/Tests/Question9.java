//	The answer is B.
//	The solution in A allows to decrease the value of bill using negative numbers as a parameter.
//	The solution in C doesn’t work because the method is private.
//	The solution in D allows to set the Bill directly (basically tampering with the bill variable).
//	The only correct solution is B as it eliminates all the problems in the other 3 solutions
